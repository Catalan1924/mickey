    <h3>About Health</h3>
    <p>In general, health refers to a state of physical, mental, and social well-being, not just the absence of disease
      or infirmity. It encompasses various aspects of a person's life, including their physical health, emotional and
      mental well-being, and social relationships.
      Here's a more detailed look at health:
      Physical Health:
      This relates to the physical well-being of the body, including its structure, function, and resistance to disease
      and injury.
      Mental Health:
      This refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being, including their ability to cope with
      stress, form relationships, and maintain a positive outlook on life.
      Social Health:
      This encompasses a person's relationships with others, their ability to participate in social activities, and
      their sense of belonging.
      Factors that influence health:
      Lifestyle: Factors like diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption significantly impact health.
      Environment: Exposure to pollutants, toxins, and infectious diseases can negatively affect health.
      Genetics: Genetic predisposition to certain diseases can influence health.
      Healthcare Access: Access to quality healthcare services can improve health outcomes. </p>

    The launch of the National Essential Medicines Lists repository marks a
    significant step forward in global health-care collaboration," said Deus
    Mubangizi, WHO’s Director of the Health Products Policy and Standards
    Department. "By providing a centralized and accessible platform, we are
    equipping policymakers, health-care professionals and researchers with the
    critical data needed to make informed decisions and foster equitable
    access to essential medicines worldwide.
